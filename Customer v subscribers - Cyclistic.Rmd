# Introduction.

Cyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations.The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assertive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

### Business task.

We are here to understand the usage of two different types of riders that are *Customers* who holds daily or hourly passes and *Subscribers* who has annual membership with the data that's collected.

Data source - <https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html>.

Data that's been collected belong to the year of 2018.

### Let's get down to business.

Loading libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
library(lubridate) 
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)
```

Loading datasets

```{r}
X2018_Q1 = read_excel("E:/Data Analytics/Case studies/Cyclistic - Case study 1/New folder/2018_Q1.xlsx")
X2018_Q2 = read_excel("E:/Data Analytics/Case studies/Cyclistic - Case study 1/New folder/2018_Q2.xlsx")
X2018_Q3 = read_excel("E:/Data Analytics/Case studies/Cyclistic - Case study 1/New folder/2018_Q3.xlsx")
X2018_Q4 = read_excel("E:/Data Analytics/Case studies/Cyclistic - Case study 1/New folder/2018_Q4.xlsx")
```

A peak at the column names to make sure it's uniform.

```{r}
colnames(X2018_Q1)
colnames(X2018_Q2)
colnames(X2018_Q3)
colnames(X2018_Q4)
```

Renaming column names of x2018_Q1 to make it consistent with other data frames.

```{r}
X2018_Q1 <- rename(X2018_Q1,"trip_id" = "01 - Rental Details Rental ID", 
                  "start_time" = "01 - Rental Details Local Start Time",
                  "end_time" = "01 - Rental Details Local End Time",
                  "bikeid" = "01 - Rental Details Bike ID",
                  "tripduration" = "01 - Rental Details Duration In Seconds Uncapped",
                  "from_station_id" = "03 - Rental Start Station ID",
                  "from_station_name" = "03 - Rental Start Station Name",
                  "to_station_id" = "02 - Rental End Station ID",
                  "to_station_name" = "02 - Rental End Station Name",
                  "usertype" = "User Type", "gender" = "Member Gender",
                  "birthyear" = "05 - Member Details Member Birthday Year")
```

Checking if the column names are updated.

```{r}
colnames(X2018_Q1)
```

Inspecting dataframes and look for incongruencies.

```{r}
str(X2018_Q1)
str(X2018_Q2)
str(X2018_Q3)
str(X2018_Q4)
```

Converting ride_id and bikeid to character so that they can stack correctly.

```{r}
X2018_Q1 <- mutate(X2018_Q1, trip_id = as.character(trip_id), bikeid = as.character(bikeid))
X2018_Q2 <- mutate(X2018_Q2, trip_id = as.character(trip_id), bikeid = as.character(bikeid))
X2018_Q3 <- mutate(X2018_Q3, trip_id = as.character(trip_id), bikeid = as.character(bikeid))
X2018_Q4 <- mutate(X2018_Q4, trip_id = as.character(trip_id), bikeid = as.character(bikeid))
```

Binding individual quarter data to one big data frame

```{r}
all_trips <- bind_rows(X2018_Q1,X2018_Q2,X2018_Q3, X2018_Q4)
```

Removing tripduration , birthyear and gender fields.

```{r}
all_trips <- all_trips %>%
  select(-c("tripduration", "birthyear", "gender" ))
```

Inspecting the data frame

```{r}
colnames(all_trips)
nrow(all_trips)
dim(all_trips)
head(all_trips)
str(all_trips)
summary(all_trips)
```

Adding columns that list the date, month, day, and year of each ride which will allow us to aggregate the ride data

```{r}
all_trips$date <- as.Date(all_trips$start_time)
all_trips$month <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%m")
all_trips$day <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%d")
all_trips$year <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%Y")
all_trips$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%A")
```

Calculating ride length for each ride and adding a new column for the same (seconds)

```{r}
all_trips$ride_length <- difftime(all_trips$end_time,all_trips$start_time)
```

Inspecting the structure

```{r}
str(all_trips)
```

Converting ride_length from factor to number to perform calculations.

```{r}
is.factor(all_trips$ride_length)
all_trips$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(all_trips$ride_length))
is.numeric(all_trips$ride_length)
```

Removing bad data as few entries in ride length were showing in negative with a new data frame.

```{r}
all_trips_v2 <- all_trips[!(all_trips$from_station_name == "HQ QR" | all_trips$ride_length<0),]
```

Time for some descriptive analysis.

```{r}
mean(all_trips_v2$ride_length)
median(all_trips_v2$ride_length)
max(all_trips_v2$ride_length)
min(all_trips_v2$ride_length)
```

Comparing subscribers vs customers.

```{r}
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$usertype, FUN = mean)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$usertype, FUN = median)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$usertype, FUN = max)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$usertype, FUN = min)
```

Average ride time by each day for subscribers vs customers.

```{r}
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$usertype + all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)

all_trips_v2$day_of_week <- ordered(all_trips_v2$day_of_week, levels=c
("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))

aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$usertype + all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
```

Analyzing ridership data by usertype and weekday

```{r}
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(start_time, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(usertype, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(usertype, weekday)
```

Adding visualization

```{r}
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(start_time, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(usertype, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(usertype, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = usertype)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

Visualization with average duration

```{r}
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(start_time, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(usertype, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(usertype, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = average_duration, fill = usertype)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")

```

Final findings.
